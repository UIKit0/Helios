Helios Development
------------------

I have no real license for this, I probably should.  I will make it MIT since I'm not really pro-GPL, but that will mean updating my files with the license at some point.  I will kick that can down the road later.


Right now this project relies on BOOT 1.46 or higher, GLM 0.9.2.3 or higher, and SOIL for image loading.  I really don't like SOIL, so I will be getting rid of it.  I plan on writing my own math library down the road, so I may ditch GLM as well.  BOOST is being used for some features [such as smart pointers] that can be replaced as C++11 support gets better, but will stay in for ptrees.

Currently this project uses a single thread, but moving to multi-threaded shouldn't be too painful.

The goal of this project is my own education.  I'm intending for it to be an entity-component pattern based engine, and I'm hoping to learn a great deal about game engine architecture and rendering techniques.  I've already put several months of work into this, and will continue on it probably for at least another year before it will have many of the features I want.

Feel free to follow or fork or point out how bad I suck.
