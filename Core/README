- Helios requires GLM 0.9.2.3 or higher.
- For now, Helios uses SOIL for image loading.
- Helios source MUST be built with -std=c++0x


This is an entity-component architecture being built.  There are some parts that need to be refactored, such as the ability to load components
dynamically via XML/JSON/Script/Etc.  Generally, all functionality and data should go into components.  Entities can contain sub-entities, but will
need some fanagling for now.  Each component type is given its own memory pool, and components are processed at the same time as other components
of the same type, instead of processing being done one entity at a time.  This should give us better code cache performance and better memory performance.

Additionally, it is the goal of this project to be able to dynamically create entities of a variety of types with XML, JSON, or Script information.
